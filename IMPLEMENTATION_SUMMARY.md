# Profile Management & Session Tracking - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the Profile Management & Session Tracking System for FocusFlow AI. All features have been successfully implemented and are ready for testing and deployment.

## What Was Built

### 1. Sequential Profile ID Generation (FOC-XXX Format)

**Feature**: Professional, sequential profile IDs for easy reference and organization.

**Implementation**:
- Modified `backend/functions/create-profile/index.js`
- Added QueryCommand to count existing profiles
- Generate IDs in format: FOC-001, FOC-002, FOC-003, etc.
- Scoped per therapist (each therapist starts from FOC-001)

**How It Works**:
```javascript
// Query existing profiles for therapist
const existingProfiles = await dynamoClient.send(new QueryCommand({
  TableName: PROFILES_TABLE,
  KeyConditionExpression: 'therapistId = :therapistId',
  ExpressionAttributeValues: {
    ':therapistId': { S: therapistId }
  },
  Select: 'COUNT'
}));

// Calculate next number and format
profileNumber = (existingProfiles.Count || 0) + 1;
const profileId = `FOC-${profileNumber.toString().padStart(3, '0')}`;
```

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/functions/create-profile/index.js`

---

### 2. Game Access Restriction

**Feature**: Users must select a profile before playing any game level.

**Implementation**:
- Split game page into server and client components
- Added profile checking on mount
- Created "Profile Required" screen with professional UI
- Added game header showing active profile during play

**User Flow**:
```
1. User navigates to /game/level1
2. System checks for active profile
3. If NO profile:
   → Shows "Profile Required" screen
   → User must select profile to continue
4. If profile EXISTS:
   → Game loads with header showing profile info
```

**Components Created**:
- `frontend/app/game/[level]/page.tsx` - Server component wrapper
- `frontend/app/game/[level]/GamePageClient.tsx` - Client component with logic
- `frontend/app/game/[level]/game.module.css` - Styles

**UI Elements**:
- Profile Required screen (white card with gradient background)
- Game header (fixed, glassmorphism effect)
- Profile info display (name and age)
- Back to Home button

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/app/game/[level]/page.tsx`
- `frontend/app/game/[level]/GamePageClient.tsx` (new)
- `frontend/app/game/[level]/game.module.css` (new)
- `frontend/components/GameCanvas.module.css` (adjusted UI positions)

### 3. Enhanced Session Data Capture

**Feature**: Comprehensive session data including profile details, timing, and performance metrics.

**Implementation**:

#### 3.1 Updated Data Interfaces
- Extended SessionData interface with new fields
- Added metrics object structure
- Added optional profile fields (weight, height)

#### 3.2 Metrics Calculation
- Created `calculateLevelMetrics()` function
- Calculates accuracy from gaze data
- Computes level-specific performance metrics

**Level-Specific Metrics**:
- **Level 1 (Follow the Leader)**: objectsFollowed, averageFollowTime
- **Level 2 (Collision Course)**: collisionsAvoided, totalCollisions
- **Level 3 (Pattern Recognition)**: patternsIdentified, distractorsIgnored

#### 3.3 Session Submission
- Integrated profile data into session payload
- Calculate sessionDuration (endTime - startTime)
- Add datePlayed in ISO format
- Include all calculated metrics

#### 3.4 Backend Storage
- Updated data-ingestor Lambda to accept new fields
- Store enhanced data in S3
- Update DynamoDB user record with metrics

**Enhanced Session Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "userId": "user_xxx",
  "sessionId": "session_xxx",
  "profileId": "FOC-001",
  "profileName": "Emma",
  "profileAge": 8,
  "profileGender": "female",
  "profileWeight": 30,
  "profileHeight": 130,
  "level": "level1",
  "startTime": 1705574400000,
  "endTime": 1705574580000,
  "sessionDuration": 180000,
  "datePlayed": "2024-01-18T10:30:00.000Z",
  "gazeData": [...],
  "events": [...],
  "metrics": {
    "totalGazePoints": 1800,
    "accurateGazes": 1540,
    "accuracyPercentage": 85.56,
    "objectsFollowed": 12,
    "averageFollowTime": 2.3
  }
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/lib/api.ts` - Updated SessionData interface
- `frontend/components/GameCanvas.tsx` - Added metrics calculation
- `backend/functions/data-ingestor/index.js` - Enhanced data storage

## Architecture

### Frontend (React/Next.js)
```
Home Page (page.tsx)
  ↓
Profile Modal (ProfileModal.tsx)
  ↓
Game Page (page.tsx + GamePageClient.tsx)
  ↓
Game Canvas (GameCanvas.tsx)
  ↓
Session Submission (api.ts)
```

### Backend (AWS)
```
API Gateway
  ↓
Lambda Functions:
  - create-profile (FOC-XXX generation)
  - get-profiles
  - delete-profile
  - data-ingestor (enhanced session storage)
  ↓
DynamoDB:
  - focusflow-profiles-dev (profile storage)
  - focusflow-users-dev (session metadata)
  ↓
S3:
  - focusflow-sessions-dev (complete session data)
```

---

## Data Flow

### Profile Creation
```
1. User fills form in ProfileModal
2. Frontend calls POST /profiles
3. Lambda queries existing profiles count
4. Generates FOC-XXX ID (sequential)
5. Stores in DynamoDB
6. Returns profile to frontend
7. Frontend updates UI
```

### Game Session
```
1. User selects profile
2. Profile cached in localStorage
3. User navigates to game
4. System checks for profile
5. If no profile → "Profile Required" screen
6. If profile exists → Game loads with header
7. User plays game
8. Gaze data and events captured
9. User ends session
10. Metrics calculated
11. Enhanced data submitted to backend
12. Stored in S3 and DynamoDB
13. AI analysis triggered (existing feature)
```

- Redeploy backend Lambda

### Backend Errors
**Solution**: Check CloudWatch logs
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/focusflow-create-profile-dev --follow
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/focusflow-data-ingestor-dev --follow
```
