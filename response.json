Specifically, visual attention is not the same as visual fixation  because it is possible to covertly attend to someone’s eyes without  looking at the eye region and conversely covertly attend elsewhere  while looking at someone’s eyes (Kulke et al., 2021, 2016). This is an important distinction to draw in the context of empirical studies that  attempt to manipulate visual attention by controlling gaze direction.Footnote 1 (continued) --- Page 5 --- 1888 Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2023) 53:1884–1905 1 3Table 1  Studies included in the review Author (Date) Sample ASD Severity IQ ASD Group Gender Break - downAge Independent  VariablesDependent  VariablesVisual Stimuli fMRI task Gaze Manipula- tion or Measure Dalton et al.

While  there is some evidence that people on the autism spectrum  experience hyperactivity in key regions of the social brain  --- Page 15 --- 1898 Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2023) 53:1884–1905 1 3 when viewing fearful faces, but hypoactivity for happy  faces (Lassalle et al., 2017), gaze cuing studies have not yet  provided consistent findings regarding neural responses to  socially rewarding expressions in ASD. Research to clarify  activation patterns in response to varying emotional expres- sions may help to integrate arousal-based and social motiva- tion theories of ASD. Given evidence that ASD represents the culmination of an  atypical developmental pathway, understanding its aetiology  is best advanced through prospective longitudinal research  initiated in infancy (Constantino et al., 2021; Johnson et al.,  2021). However, the vast majority of research, including the  papers reviewed here, use between-subjects approaches to  identify differences between people with and without diag- noses of ASD. Longitudinal eye-tracking studies commenc- ing prior to ASD diagnosis may help to better understand  the relationship between autonomic arousal, eye gaze and  the development of social communication difficulties. For  example, a recent study showed that infants at risk of ASD  have greater pupillary arousal responses to emotional faces,  with these responses predicting greater attention to faces at  9 months of age, but reduced attention to faces and lower  social functioning at 18 months of age (Wagner et al., 2016).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Research Finding 3 (from 10803_2022_Article_5443)\\nRelevance Score: 48.1%\\n\\nStimuli pre- sented for 2 sImitation  and passive  observation  of facial  expressionsFixation cross  used to cue  attention to  the eyes.

For  example, a recent study showed that infants at risk of ASD  have greater pupillary arousal responses to emotional faces,  with these responses predicting greater attention to faces at  9 months of age, but reduced attention to faces and lower  social functioning at 18 months of age (Wagner et al., 2016). Additional longitudinal research is necessary to determine if  hyperarousal in response to faces is an inherited physiologi - cal trait with downstream consequences for eye avoidance  and social development or, instead, a consequence of ASD  itself. Although preferential gaze to the eye region is highly  heritable (Constantino et al., 2017), infants later diagnosed  with ASD cannot be reliably differentiated from typically  developing infants on the basis of eye gaze until 12 months  of age (Rozga et al., 2011; Zwaigenbaum et al., 2005). In  fact, at six months of age, infants later diagnosed with  ASD may show greater preference for looking at faces, and  the eyes within faces, than their typically developing peers  (Elsabbagh et al., 2013; Ozonoff et al., 2010). However,  eye contact in these infants declines significantly between  2 and 24 months of age (Jones & Klin, 2013; Ozonoff   et al., 2010), with steeper declines associated with more  severe social difficulties (Jones & Klin, 2013). A declining  trajectory of eye contact during the first two years of life  suggests that genetic liabilities are not sufficient to cause  reductions in eye gaze, but instead interact with environ- mental factors in an iterative fashion (Constantino et al.,  2017).\\n\",\"chunks\":[{\"paper\":\"10803_2022_Article_5443\",\"text\":\"Evidence suggests that neural responses dif- fer for dynamic and static facial stimuli (Kilts et al., 2003;  1 Note that the terms used in the literature sometimes confound con- structs.
