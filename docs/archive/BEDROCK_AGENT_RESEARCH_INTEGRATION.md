## 📊 Example Flow

**User**: "Analyze this session: fixation duration 280ms, 45 saccades/min"

**Agent thinks**: 
1. "I need to understand what these metrics mean"
2. Calls `searchResearch("fixation duration cognitive load")`
3. Gets research: "Fixation duration of 250-300ms indicates focused attention..."
4. Calls `searchResearch("saccade patterns attention")`
5. Gets research: "Saccade frequency correlates with visual search efficiency..."

**Agent responds**:
"Based on the session data and current research, the child demonstrated strong focused attention. Research indicates that fixation durations of 280ms fall within the optimal range for cognitive processing tasks (250-300ms). The saccade rate of 45 per minute suggests active visual exploration..."

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Direct Lambda Test

```bash
aws lambda invoke \
  --function-name focusflow-research-rag-dev \
  --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \
  --payload '{"inputText":"fixation duration cognitive processing"}' \
  response.json && cat response.json | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Expected**: Returns 5 relevant research findings with similarity scores

### Test 2: Agent Integration Test

```bash
./scripts/test-agent-with-research.sh
```

**Expected**: Agent analyzes metrics AND cites research in response

### Test 3: Manual Agent Test

```bash
# Get agent alias ID
ALIAS_ID=$(aws bedrock-agent list-agent-aliases \
  --agent-id QPVURTILVY \
  --query 'agentAliasSummaries[0].agentAliasId' \
  --output text)

# Test query
aws bedrock-agent-runtime invoke-agent \
  --agent-id QPVURTILVY \
  --agent-alias-id "$ALIAS_ID" \
  --session-id "test-$(date +%s)" \
  --input-text "What does a fixation duration of 300ms indicate?" \
  response.txt

# View response
cat response.txt | jq -r '.completion[]?.chunk?.bytes' | base64 -d
```

## 📝 Agent Instructions (Updated)

The agent now knows to:

1. **Search research when analyzing metrics**
   - Example: "fixation duration cognitive load"
   - Example: "saccade velocity attention patterns"

2. **Incorporate findings naturally**
   - "Research shows that..."
   - "Studies indicate..."
   - "According to eye-tracking research..."

3. **Provide context for observations**
   - Compare child's metrics to research benchmarks
   - Explain what metrics mean based on studies
   - Support recommendations with scientific evidence

## 💰 Cost Impact

| Component | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| Lambda RAG (existing) | ~$1-2 |
| Bedrock Agent invocations | ~$5-10 |
| Research searches (embeddings) | ~$0.50 |
| **Total** | **~$7-13/month** |

Still **$687-693/month cheaper** than OpenSearch Serverless!

## 🎯 What the Agent Can Do Now

### Before (Without Research)
```
Agent: "Your child had a fixation duration of 280ms. This is good."
```

### After (With Research)
```
Agent: "Your child demonstrated a fixation duration of 280ms, which research 
indicates falls within the optimal range for focused attention tasks (250-300ms). 
Studies show that this duration suggests effective cognitive processing and 
information extraction. This is a positive indicator of sustained attention 
capabilities."
```

## 🔍 Available Research Topics

Based on the processed paper, the agent can provide context on:

- Eye tracking accuracy and precision
- Fixation duration and cognitive load
- Saccade patterns and attention
- Visual search strategies
- Attention allocation
- Cognitive processing indicators
- Eye movement analysis
- Gaze behavior patterns

## 📚 Adding More Research Papers

To expand the knowledge base:

```bash
# 1. Add PDFs to papers directory
cp new-papers/*.pdf backend/bedrock/knowledge-base/research/papers/

# 2. Process them
python3 scripts/process-research-papers.py backend/bedrock/knowledge-base/research/papers

# 3. Done! Agent automatically uses new research (within 1 hour due to Lambda cache)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test the Integration

Run the test script:
```bash
./scripts/test-agent-with-research.sh
```

### 2. Try Different Queries

Test various scenarios:
- "What does high fixation duration mean?"
- "Explain saccade patterns in children"
- "How does eye tracking measure attention?"

### 3. Monitor Usage

Check Lambda logs:
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/focusflow-research-rag-dev --follow
```

Check agent invocations:
```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/Bedrock \
  --metric-name Invocations \
  --dimensions Name=AgentId,Value=QPVURTILVY \
  --start-time $(date -u -d '1 hour ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) \
  --end-time $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S) \
  --period 3600 \
  --statistics Sum
```

### 4. Refine Agent Instructions

Based on testing, you can refine when/how the agent searches research by updating:
```
backend/bedrock/prompts/analysis-prompt.txt
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
cd infra/terraform
terraform apply -target=module.bedrock.aws_bedrockagent_agent.focusflow
aws bedrock-agent prepare-agent --agent-id QPVURTILVY
```

## 🎓 Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Session Analysis
**Input**: Raw session data with metrics
**Agent**: 
1. Calculates metrics
2. Searches: "fixation duration attention"
3. Searches: "saccade patterns cognitive load"
4. Compiles report with research-backed insights

### Use Case 2: Progress Tracking
**Input**: Multiple sessions over time
**Agent**:
1. Compares metrics across sessions
2. Searches: "eye tracking development children"
3. Provides context on typical development patterns
4. Highlights progress with scientific backing

### Use Case 3: Recommendations
**Input**: Areas for improvement identified
**Agent**:
1. Searches: "eye tracking training exercises"
2. Searches: "attention improvement techniques"
3. Provides evidence-based recommendations
4. Cites relevant research

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Agent doesn't cite research
- Check agent logs for action group invocations
- Verify Lambda permissions
- Test Lambda directly to ensure it's working
- Check agent instructions are updated

### Research results not relevant
- Refine search queries in agent instructions
- Add more research papers
- Adjust topK parameter (currently 5)

### Lambda timeout
- Increase memory (more memory = faster CPU)
- Check embeddings file size
- Monitor cold start times
