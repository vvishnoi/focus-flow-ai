# âœ… Profile Management Feature - Implementation Complete

## What's Been Added

### 1. Profile Management System
A complete profile management interface for therapists to create and manage child profiles.

**Features:**
- âœ… Create profiles with name, age, gender, weight, height
- âœ… View all profiles in a responsive grid
- âœ… Select active profile before playing
- âœ… Delete profiles with confirmation
- âœ… Profile persistence in localStorage
- âœ… Profile validation (required fields)

### 2. Updated User Flow
**Before:**
```
Open App â†’ Play Game â†’ Session Saved
```

**After:**
```
Open App â†’ Select/Create Profile â†’ Play Game â†’ Session Saved with Profile Data
```

### 3. Files Created

**Frontend:**
```
frontend/lib/profiles.ts                    - Profile management utilities
frontend/app/profiles/page.tsx              - Profile management UI
frontend/app/profiles/profiles.module.css   - Profile page styles
PROFILE_FEATURE.md                          - Feature documentation
PROFILE_SETUP_COMPLETE.md                   - This file
```

### 4. Files Updated

**Frontend:**
```
frontend/app/page.tsx                       - Added profile check & banner
frontend/app/page.module.css                - Profile banner styles
frontend/components/GameCanvas.tsx          - Include profile in sessions
frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx             - Show active profile
frontend/app/dashboard/dashboard.module.css - Profile banner styles
frontend/lib/api.ts                         - Updated SessionData interface
```

**Backend:**
```
backend/functions/data-ingestor/index.js    - Store profile data
```

## How It Works

### Profile Storage (Frontend)
Profiles are stored in browser localStorage:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('focusflow_profiles', JSON.stringify([...]))
localStorage.setItem('focusflow_active_profile', 'profile_id')
```

### Session Submission (Backend)
Profile data is included in every session:
```json
{
  "userId": "user_xxx",
  "sessionId": "session_xxx",
  "profileId": "profile_xxx",
  "profileName": "John Doe",
  "profileAge": 8,
  "profileGender": "male",
  "level": "level1",
  ...
}
```

### AI Analysis
The Bedrock Agent can now use:
- **Age** for age-appropriate benchmarks
- **Gender** for demographic analysis
- **Name** for personalized reports
- **Weight/Height** for future physical development tracking

## Testing the Feature

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Run Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or for HTTPS (mobile testing)
npm run dev:https
```

### 3. Test Profile Creation
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. You'll be redirected to /profiles
3. Click "Create New Profile"
4. Fill in:
   - Name: "Test Child"
   - Age: 8
   - Gender: Male
   - Weight: 30 (optional)
   - Height: 130 (optional)
5. Click "Create Profile"
6. Profile should appear in grid

### 4. Test Profile Selection
1. Click "Select Profile" on a profile card
2. You'll be redirected to home page
3. Profile banner should show: "Playing as: Test Child | Age 8"
4. Click "Change Profile" to switch

### 5. Test Game Session
1. Select a game level
2. Complete calibration
3. Play for 30 seconds
4. End session
5. Open browser console
6. Look for: "Submitting session to backend..."
7. Verify profile data is included

### 6. Test Dashboard
1. Click "View Progress Dashboard"
2. Profile banner should show active profile
3. Reports are filtered by profile (future enhancement)

### 7. Test Profile Deletion
1. Go to /profiles
2. Click the Ã— button on a profile
3. Confirm deletion
4. Profile should be removed

## Deployment

### Deploy Frontend
```bash
# From project root
./scripts/deploy-frontend.sh
```

### Deploy Backend
```bash
cd infra/terraform
terraform apply
```

The Lambda function will be updated with profile field handling.

## API Changes

### POST /submit-session

**New Required Fields:**
- `profileId` (string)
- `profileName` (string)
- `profileAge` (number)
- `profileGender` (string)

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST $API_URL/submit-session \

  -d '{
    "userId": "user_123",
    "sessionId": "session_456",
    "profileId": "profile_789",
    "profileName": "John Doe",
    "profileAge": 8,
    "profileGender": "male",
    "level": "level1",
    "startTime": 1234567890000,
    "endTime": 1234567900000,
    "gazeData": [],
    "events": []
  }'
```

## Database Schema

### DynamoDB Users Table
```
userId (S) - Partition Key
profileId (S) - Current profile ID
profileName (S) - Profile name
profileAge (N) - Profile age
profileGender (S) - Profile gender
lastSessionId (S) - Last session ID
lastSessionTime (N) - Last session timestamp
updatedAt (N) - Last update timestamp
```

### S3 Session Data
```json
{
  "userId": "user_xxx",
  "sessionId": "session_xxx",
  "profileId": "profile_xxx",
  "profileName": "John Doe",
  "profileAge": 8,
  "profileGender": "male",
  "level": "level1",
  "startTime": 1234567890000,
  "endTime": 1234567900000,
  "gazeData": [...],
  "events": [...],
  "uploadedAt": 1234567890000
}
```

## UI Design

- **Create Button**: "+ Create New Profile" (prominent)
- **Form**: Modal-style form with all fields
- **Grid**: Responsive grid of profile cards
- **Cards**: Name, age, gender, weight, height, select/delete buttons

### Home Page
- **Profile Banner**: White card with profile info and "Change Profile" button
- **Game Levels**: Existing level selection cards
- **Dashboard Link**: Existing link to dashboard

### Dashboard
- **Profile Banner**: Shows which profile's reports are displayed
- **Reports**: Existing report cards

## Color Scheme
- **Primary**: Purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
- **Background**: Dark gradient (#000 to #1a1a2e)
- **Cards**: White with subtle shadows
- **Text**: Dark gray (#333) on light, white on dark
- **Accents**: Purple for buttons and highlights

## Responsive Design

- **Mobile**: Single column, full-width cards

## Browser Compatibility
- âœ… Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- âœ… Safari (iOS/macOS)
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Mobile browsers (with HTTPS)

## Security Considerations
- Profiles stored locally (no server-side auth needed)
- No sensitive data in profiles
- Profile data included in backend for analysis
- CORS configured for API access
- HTTPS required for camera access

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2
- Profile photos/avatars
- Profile-specific game settings
- Export profile data
- Profile statistics dashboard
- Bulk profile import

### Phase 3
- Multi-therapist support
- Parent/guardian portal
- Medical history fields
- Therapy goals tracking
- Progress milestones

## Known Limitations
- Profiles stored in browser localStorage (cleared if cache cleared)
- No cloud sync between devices
- No authentication/authorization
- Single therapist assumption
- No profile backup/restore

## Troubleshooting

### Profile not persisting
- Check browser localStorage
- Ensure cookies/storage not blocked
- Try different browser

### Profile not showing in session
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify active profile is set
- Check API request payload

### Backend not receiving profile data
- Check Lambda logs in CloudWatch
- Verify API Gateway configuration
- Check CORS settings

## Support

For issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check CloudWatch logs for backend errors
3. Verify localStorage has profile data
4. Test with different browsers
5. Clear cache and try again

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

The profile management feature is now complete and ready for testing. Therapists can:
- Create multiple child profiles
- Select which child is playing
- Track sessions per child
- View child-specific reports
- Manage all profiles from one interface

The AI analysis can now provide age-appropriate insights and personalized recommendations based on each child's profile!
