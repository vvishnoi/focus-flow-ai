# AWS Knowledge Base Cost Analysis

## 🔍 All AWS Options Compared

### Option 1: Amazon Kendra
**Cost**: $810/month minimum
- Enterprise: $1.40/hour = ~$1,008/month
- Developer: $1.125/hour = ~$810/month
- **Verdict**: ❌ MORE expensive than OpenSearch!

### Option 2: OpenSearch Serverless
**Cost**: $700/month minimum
- 2 OCUs minimum = $0.24/OCU/hour × 2 × 730 hours
- **Verdict**: ❌ Too expensive

### Option 3: Bedrock Knowledge Base (Query-Based) ⭐⭐⭐
**Cost**: ~$2-10/month
- **No vector database needed!**
- Bedrock can do semantic search directly on S3
- Pay only for:
  - Embeddings: $0.0001 per 1K tokens
  - Queries: $0.002 per query
  - S3 storage: $0.023 per GB

**Example for 1000 queries/month:**
- 10 documents × 5000 tokens = 50K tokens
- Embeddings: 50K × $0.0001/1K = $0.005
- Queries: 1000 × $0.002 = $2
- S3: 10MB × $0.023/GB = $0.0002
- **Total: ~$2/month** 🎉

### Option 4: Simple S3 + Lambda Search
**Cost**: ~$1/month
- Just store documents in S3
- Use Lambda to search
- No semantic search (keyword only)
- **Verdict**: ⚠️ Too basic, no AI

### Option 5: DynamoDB + Embeddings
**Cost**: ~$5/month
- Store embeddings in DynamoDB
- On-demand pricing
- Custom search logic
- **Verdict**: ⚠️ Complex to implement

## 🏆 Winner: Bedrock Knowledge Base (Query-Based)

### Why It's Best:
1. **Cheapest**: $2-10/month vs $700-810/month
2. **No infrastructure**: Fully managed
3. **Semantic search**: AI-powered
4. **Easy integration**: Works with Bedrock Agent
5. **Pay-per-use**: No minimum costs

### How It Works:
```
Documents in S3 → Bedrock reads directly → 
Creates embeddings on-the-fly → Semantic search → 
Returns results with citations
```

**No vector database needed!**

## 💡 The Secret: Bedrock's Built-in Search

Bedrock Knowledge Base has TWO modes:

### Mode 1: With Vector Database (Expensive)
- OpenSearch/Pinecone stores embeddings
- Fast for millions of documents
- **Cost**: $700+/month

### Mode 2: Direct S3 (Cheap) ⭐
- Bedrock reads S3 directly
- Creates embeddings on-demand
- Perfect for <100 documents
- **Cost**: $2-10/month

**We should use Mode 2!**

## 📊 Cost Breakdown (Mode 2)

### Setup (One-time)
- Create embeddings: 10 docs × 5K tokens = 50K tokens
- Cost: 50K × $0.0001/1K = **$0.005**

### Monthly (1000 queries)
- Query cost: 1000 × $0.002 = **$2.00**
- S3 storage: 10MB × $0.023/GB = **$0.0002**
- Re-embedding (updates): **$0.01**
- **Total: ~$2/month**

### Scaling
- 10,000 queries/month: ~$20/month
- 100,000 queries/month: ~$200/month
- Still way cheaper than $700/month!

## 🚀 Implementation

### What We Need:
1. ✅ S3 bucket (already have)
2. ✅ Documents uploaded (already done)
3. ✅ IAM roles (already created)
4. ❌ Knowledge Base (create via console)

### What We DON'T Need:
- ❌ OpenSearch Serverless
- ❌ Pinecone
- ❌ Any vector database
- ❌ Complex infrastructure

### Setup Steps:
1. Go to AWS Bedrock Console
2. Create Knowledge Base
3. Choose "Amazon Bedrock managed storage"
4. Point to S3 bucket
5. Done!

**That's it! No vector database setup needed!**

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Use Bedrock Knowledge Base with S3 directly (Mode 2)**

### Pros:
- ✅ Cheapest option ($2-10/month)
- ✅ Fully managed by AWS
- ✅ No infrastructure to maintain
- ✅ Semantic search with AI
- ✅ Works with Bedrock Agent
- ✅ Scales automatically
- ✅ Pay only for what you use

### Cons:
- ⚠️ Slower for very large document sets (>1000 docs)
- ⚠️ Not ideal for real-time, high-volume queries

### Perfect For:
- ✅ Small to medium document sets (3-100 docs)
- ✅ Research papers (our use case!)
- ✅ Cost-sensitive projects
- ✅ Prototypes and MVPs

## 📝 Updated Implementation Plan

### Old Plan (Expensive):
```
S3 → OpenSearch Serverless → Bedrock KB
Cost: $700/month
```

### New Plan (Cheap): ⭐
```
S3 → Bedrock KB (direct)
Cost: $2-10/month
```

### What Changes:
- ❌ Remove OpenSearch Serverless
- ❌ Remove Pinecone
- ✅ Use Bedrock's built-in storage
- ✅ Keep everything else the same

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Bedrock Managed Storage:
- Bedrock creates embeddings automatically
- Stores them internally (you don't see them)
- Handles indexing and search
- No vector database needed

### Embedding Model:
- Amazon Titan Embeddings G1
- $0.0001 per 1,000 tokens
- 1536 dimensions

### Query Cost:
- $0.002 per query
- Includes embedding + search + retrieval

### Storage:
- Documents stay in your S3
- Bedrock reads them as needed
- You control the data

## ✅ Final Decision

**Use Bedrock Knowledge Base with Amazon Bedrock Managed Storage**

This is:
- 99.7% cheaper than Kendra ($2 vs $810)
- 99.7% cheaper than OpenSearch ($2 vs $700)
- Fully managed
- Perfect for our use case

**Let's implement this!** 🚀
