# OpenSearch Serverless vs S3-Only Knowledge Base

## Cost Comparison

### Option 1: OpenSearch Serverless (Full-Featured)
**Monthly Cost**: ~$700-800
- OpenSearch Serverless: ~$700/month (minimum 2 OCUs)
- S3 storage: ~$1/month
- Bedrock queries: ~$50/month
- **Total**: ~$751/month

**Pros**:
- Advanced semantic search
- Better relevance scoring
- Supports complex queries
- Scalable for large document sets

**Cons**:
- Very expensive for small projects
- Overkill for 3-10 documents
- Minimum cost even with no usage

### Option 2: S3-Only Knowledge Base (Cost-Effective) ⭐
**Monthly Cost**: ~$51
- S3 storage: ~$1/month
- Bedrock queries: ~$50/month
- **Total**: ~$51/month

**Pros**:
- 93% cost savings
- Sufficient for small document sets
- No minimum costs
- Easy to set up

**Cons**:
- Less sophisticated search
- May have lower relevance for complex queries
- Limited to smaller document sets

## Recommendation

For FocusFlow AI with 3-10 research papers:

**Use S3-Only Knowledge Base** ⭐

Reasons:
1. **Cost**: Save $700/month
2. **Scale**: 3-10 documents don't need OpenSearch
3. **Simplicity**: Easier to set up and maintain
4. **Sufficient**: Bedrock's built-in search is good enough
5. **Upgrade Path**: Can add OpenSearch later if needed

## Implementation Decision

I'll implement **Option 2 (S3-Only)** for now. You can always upgrade to OpenSearch later if you need:
- More than 50 documents
- Complex semantic search
- Advanced relevance tuning

**Proceeding with S3-Only Knowledge Base setup!**
