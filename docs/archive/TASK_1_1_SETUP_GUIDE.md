# Task 1.1: Create S3 Bucket for Research Documents - Setup Guide

## ✅ What Was Implemented

I've set up the infrastructure for storing research documents in S3 for the Bedrock Knowledge Base.

### Files Created/Modified

1. **`infra/terraform/modules/bedrock/main.tf`** - Enhanced with:
   - Public access block for security
   - Folder structure (papers/, extracted/, metadata/)
   - Research metadata upload

2. **`backend/bedrock/knowledge-base/research-metadata.json`** - Created:
   - Metadata for 3 research papers
   - Document tracking information
   - Key findings and topics

3. **`scripts/prepare-research-documents.sh`** - Created:
   - Downloads research papers from URLs
   - Extracts text from PDFs and HTML
   - Prepares documents for upload

4. **`scripts/upload-research-documents.sh`** - Created:
   - Uploads papers to S3
   - Uploads extracted text
   - Verifies upload completion

5. **`infra/terraform/outputs.tf`** - Enhanced:
   - Added `bedrock_kb_bucket_name` output

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Install Required Tools

**On macOS:**
```bash
brew install poppler html2text
```

**On Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils html2text
```

### Step 2: Prepare Research Documents

```bash
# Download and extract research papers
./scripts/prepare-research-documents.sh
```

This will:
- Download 3 research papers
- Extract text from PDFs and HTML
- Save to `backend/bedrock/knowledge-base/research/`

### Step 3: Deploy Infrastructure

```bash
cd infra/terraform

# Review changes
terraform plan

# Deploy
terraform apply
```

This will:
- Create/update S3 bucket with folder structure
- Upload research metadata
- Configure bucket policies

### Step 4: Upload Research Documents

```bash
# Upload papers and extracted text to S3
./scripts/upload-research-documents.sh
```

This will:
- Upload PDFs and HTML files to `papers/` folder
- Upload extracted text to `extracted/` folder
- Verify uploads

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
# Get bucket name
cd infra/terraform
BUCKET=$(terraform output -raw bedrock_kb_bucket_name)

# List contents
aws s3 ls s3://$BUCKET/ --recursive

# Should see:
# papers/PMC3925117.pdf
# papers/PMC10123036.html
# papers/healthline-eye-gazing.html
# extracted/PMC3925117.txt
# extracted/PMC10123036.txt
# extracted/healthline-eye-gazing.txt
# metadata/research-metadata.json
```

## 📚 Research Documents

### 1. PMC3925117 - Eye Gaze in Autism Spectrum Disorder
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3925117/pdf/nihms3881.pdf
- **Topics**: Autism, eye-tracking, social attention, fixation duration
- **Key Findings**:
  - Fixation duration of 200-300ms is typical for ages 6-10
  - Reduced eye contact is an early indicator
  - Social attention differs in ASD vs typical development

### 2. PMC10123036 - Eye-Tracking Technology in Healthcare
- **URL**: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10123036/
- **Topics**: Eye-tracking, healthcare, cognitive load, saccade metrics
- **Key Findings**:
  - Saccade velocity of 250-350°/s indicates normal function
  - Eye-tracking provides objective attention data
  - Useful for diagnosis and monitoring

### 3. Healthline - Eye Gazing Benefits
- **URL**: https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-gazing
- **Topics**: Eye-gazing, emotional regulation, focus training
- **Key Findings**:
  - Eye gazing improves emotional regulation
  - Sustained eye contact builds social connection
  - Focus training enhances attention span

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- [ ] S3 bucket created with correct name
- [ ] Folder structure exists (papers/, extracted/, metadata/)
- [ ] Research metadata uploaded
- [ ] All 3 papers downloaded
- [ ] Text extracted from all documents
- [ ] Papers uploaded to S3
- [ ] Extracted text uploaded to S3
- [ ] Bucket is private (public access blocked)
- [ ] Versioning enabled
- [ ] Encryption enabled

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: pdftotext not found
**Solution**: Install poppler-utils
```bash
# macOS
brew install poppler

# Linux
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

### Issue: html2text not found
**Solution**: Install html2text
```bash
# macOS
brew install html2text

# Linux
sudo apt-get install html2text
```

### Issue: Cannot download papers
**Solution**: Check internet connection and URLs
```bash
# Test download manually
curl -L "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3925117/pdf/nihms3881.pdf" -o test.pdf
```

### Issue: Upload script fails
**Solution**: Ensure Terraform is deployed first
```bash
cd infra/terraform
terraform apply
```

### Issue: Bucket not found
**Solution**: Check Terraform output
```bash
cd infra/terraform
terraform output bedrock_kb_bucket_name
```

## 📊 Cost Impact

**S3 Storage Costs:**
- Research documents: ~10 MB
- Cost: ~$0.023 per GB/month
- **Estimated**: < $0.01/month

**S3 Request Costs:**
- Uploads: One-time
- Reads: Minimal (only for Knowledge Base sync)
- **Estimated**: < $0.01/month

**Total Additional Cost**: < $0.02/month

## 🎯 Next Steps

After completing Task 1.1, proceed to:

**Task 1.2**: Create OpenSearch Serverless collection
- Set up vector storage for embeddings
- Configure network and encryption
- Create index for documents

**Task 1.3**: Create Bedrock Knowledge Base
- Connect to S3 data source
- Configure OpenSearch as vector store
- Set embedding model
- Sync documents

## ✅ Task 1.1 Complete!

You now have:
- ✅ S3 bucket for research documents
- ✅ Folder structure for organization
- ✅ Research metadata tracking
- ✅ Scripts for document management
- ✅ 3 research papers ready for Knowledge Base

**Ready to move to Task 1.2: Create OpenSearch Serverless collection!**
