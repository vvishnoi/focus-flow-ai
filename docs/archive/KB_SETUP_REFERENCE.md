## üìä After Setup

### Get Knowledge Base ID

1. In the Knowledge Base page, look at the URL
2. Copy the ID (looks like: `ABCDEFGHIJ`)
3. Or run:
   ```bash
   aws bedrock-agent list-knowledge-bases --query 'knowledgeBaseSummaries[?name==`focusflow-research-kb-dev`].knowledgeBaseId' --output text
   ```

### Save for Later

You'll need the Knowledge Base ID for:
- Integrating with Bedrock Agent
- Querying from code
- Adding more documents

## üí∞ Cost Estimate

For your usage (estimated 1,000 queries/month):
- Embeddings: $0.005 (one-time)
- Queries: $2.00/month
- S3: $0.0002/month
- **Total: ~$2/month**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Can't find IAM role?
- Make sure you're in the correct AWS region (us-east-1)
- Role name: `focusflow-kb-role-dev`

### Sync fails?
- Check S3 bucket has files: `aws s3 ls s3://focusflow-bedrock-kb-dev/papers/`
- Verify IAM role has S3 permissions

### No results from test?
- Wait for sync to complete (check status)
- Try re-syncing the data source
- Check that files are in the correct S3 path
