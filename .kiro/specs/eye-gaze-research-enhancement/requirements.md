# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances FocusFlow AI with evidence-based eye-gazing techniques from clinical research and integrates a knowledge base with AWS Bedrock for AI-powered insights. The system will implement scientifically-validated eye-tracking exercises, build a research-backed knowledge base, and provide contextual recommendations based on peer-reviewed studies.

## Research Summary

### Key Findings from Research Papers

**1. Eye Gaze in Autism Spectrum Disorder (PMC3925117)**
- Atypical gaze patterns are early indicators of developmental concerns
- Reduced eye contact and social attention are key markers
- Eye-tracking can measure attention to faces, objects, and social cues
- Quantitative metrics: fixation duration, saccade patterns, attention distribution

**2. Eye-Tracking Technology in Healthcare (PMC10123036)**
- Eye-tracking provides objective, quantifiable data
- Useful for attention assessment, cognitive load measurement
- Can detect subtle changes in visual attention patterns
- Applications in diagnosis, monitoring, and intervention

**3. Eye Gazing Benefits (Healthline)**
- Improves social connection and emotional regulation
- Enhances focus and attention span
- Builds trust and communication skills
- Therapeutic benefits for anxiety and attention disorders

4. WHEN viewing trends THEN the system SHALL highlight improvements in social attention
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include research-based interpretation
6. WHEN setting goals THEN the system SHALL suggest evidence-based targets

### Requirement 4: Enhanced Game Levels Based on Research

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want game levels that target specific clinical outcomes so that interventions are purposeful and measurable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Level 1 is played THEN the system SHALL measure sustained attention and object tracking (research-validated)
2. WHEN Level 2 is played THEN the system SHALL assess divided attention and inhibitory control
3. WHEN Level 3 is played THEN the system SHALL evaluate pattern recognition and cognitive flexibility
4. WHEN a new level is added THEN the system SHALL include face-tracking exercises for social attention
5. WHEN games are designed THEN the system SHALL incorporate gradual difficulty progression based on research
6. WHEN exercises are created THEN the system SHALL target specific attention deficits identified in research

### Requirement 5: AI-Powered Insights with Research Context

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want AI-generated insights backed by research so that recommendations are credible and actionable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI analyzes a session THEN the system SHALL query the knowledge base for relevant research
2. WHEN generating insights THEN the system SHALL cite specific papers and findings
3. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL reference evidence-based interventions
4. WHEN comparing profiles THEN the system SHALL use research-based developmental norms
5. WHEN identifying concerns THEN the system SHALL reference clinical indicators from research
6. WHEN suggesting next steps THEN the system SHALL provide research-backed strategies

### Requirement 6: Research Document Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage research documents in the knowledge base so that the AI has up-to-date scientific information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading documents THEN the system SHALL accept PDF, text, and markdown formats
2. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL extract text and create embeddings
3. WHEN documents are added THEN the system SHALL update the Bedrock Knowledge Base
4. WHEN searching research THEN the system SHALL return relevant passages with citations
5. WHEN documents are removed THEN the system SHALL update the knowledge base accordingly
6. WHEN viewing documents THEN the system SHALL display metadata (title, authors, publication date)

### Requirement 7: Bedrock Agent with Knowledge Base

**User Story:** As a system, I want a Bedrock Agent that can query research so that AI responses are evidence-based.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent is created THEN the system SHALL configure it with the knowledge base
2. WHEN analyzing sessions THEN the agent SHALL retrieve relevant research passages
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the agent SHALL include citations and references
4. WHEN answering questions THEN the agent SHALL ground responses in research
5. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the agent SHALL explain the evidence basis
