# Clear Profile Feature - Privacy & Security

## ✅ What's Been Added

A **"Clear Profile"** button that allows therapists to log out the current patient and clear the active profile from the session. This is essential for:

- **Privacy**: Prevent next patient from seeing previous patient's info
- **Security**: Clear sensitive data between sessions
- **Multi-patient workflow**: Easy transition between patients

## 🎯 Feature Details

The "Clear Profile" button appears in two places:

1. **Home Page** - In the profile banner at the top

### Button Design
- **Color**: Red (#dc3545) to indicate logout/clear action
- **Position**: Next to "Change Profile" button
- **Label**: "Clear Profile"
